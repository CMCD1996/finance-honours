abstract = {We use an experimental conjoint analysis to investigate the investment criteria of 749 private equity investors, distinguishing between family offices, business angels, venture capital funds, growth equity funds, and leveraged buyout funds. Our results indicate that revenue growth is the most important investment criterion, followed by the value-added of product/service, the management team's track record, and profitability. Regarding differences across investor types, we find that family offices, growth equity funds, and leveraged buyout funds place a higher value on profitability as compared to business angels and venture capital funds. Venture capital funds, in turn, pay more attention to companies' revenue growth, business models, and current investors. With these results, our study contributes to the corporate finance literature by deepening our understanding of how different types of private equity investors make investment decisions.}

We find successful and failed VC-financed firms achieve larger scale but are not more profitable at exit than matched non-VC-financed firms. Cumulative failure rates of VC-financed firms are lower, with the difference driven largely by lower failure rates in the initial years after receiving VC. Our results are not driven by VCs disguising failures as acquisitions or by certain types of VCs. The performance difference between VC- and non-VC-financed firms narrows in the post-internet bubble years, but does not disappear.},

abstract = {This paper examines the determinants and consequences of investor activism in venture capital. Using a hand-collected sample of European venture capital deals, it shows the importance of human capital. Venture capital firms with partners that have prior business experience are more active recruiting managers and directors, helping with fundraising, and interacting more frequently with their portfolio companies. Independent venture capital firms are also more active than ‘captive’ (bank-, corporate-, or government-owned) firms. After controlling for endogeneity, investor activism is shown to be positively related to the success of portfolio companies.}

We focus on single entity establishments to cleanly examine the impact of PE and VC financing on establishments’ organic growth. This study reveals that PE and VC financing have positive impacts on single entity business establishments’ net sales and employment growth. The impact of PE financing on establishments’ growth is slower and smaller than VC financing. However, we find that the benefit of PE financing lasts longer than VC financing. We also find that ethnic minority, female, and foreign business owners are less likely to receive PE and VC financing. Finally, we find evidence that although establishments with government contracts are more likely to receive PE and VC financing, those contracts fail to produce marginal post-funding growth and employment benefits.}

Our findings go beyond existing research, first by providing a detailed exploration of VCs’ team evaluation criteria, and second by investigating the moderator variable of VC experience. Our results reveal utility trade–offs between team characteristics and thus provide answers to questions such as “What strength does it take to compensate for a weakness in characteristic A?” Moreover, our analysis reveals that novice VCs tend to focus on the qualifications of individual team members, while experienced VCs focus more on team cohesion. Data were obtained in a conjoint experiment with 51 professionals in VC firms and analyzed using discrete choice econometric models. }

abstract = {Network analysis holds a prominent place in geographic information systems (GIS), which is a reflection of the earliest GIS data models that were implemented, its broad usefulness across domain areas, and its potential for future development. A network is a fundamental representation of space which can accurately represent a wide range of relationships. There is a scientific foundation for network analysis in the mathematical subdisciplines of graph theory and topology, along with referencing schemes that allow for geographic locations to be specified by their positions on a network. Within GIS, analytical methods for network applications have been developed that allow one to describe and measure networks, associate network events spatially, locate facilities on networks, and examine movement across networks. The field of network spatial statistics is quickly developing ways to infer the significance of network events with regard to their spatial and spatio-temporal properties. Interest in network analysis in GIS is high within many applications areas including transportation planning, utilities management, environmental analysis, social network analysis, and many more. Network analysis in GIS is an active research area today and is likely to see significant development of new methods for the foreseeable future.}
